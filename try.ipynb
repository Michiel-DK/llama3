       "['Summarize the transcript of operator good morning and welcome to dun bradstreets financial results for the second quarter of 2024. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to sean anthony vice president of fpa and investor relations. please go ahead. sean anthony thank you. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for dun bradstreets financial results conference call for the second quarter of 2024. on the call today we have dun bradstreets ceo anthony jabbour and cfo bryan hipsher. anthony will begin with an overview of our second quarter results and then pass it to bryan for an indepth financial review. we will then finish up with qa and a few closing remarks. before we begin allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forwardlooking statements. this call including the qa portion of the call may include forwardlooking statements related to the expected future results for our company and are therefore forwardlooking statements. our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. the risks and uncertainties that forwardlooking statements are subject to are described in our earnings release and other sec filings. todays remarks will also include references to nongaap financial measures. additional information including the reconciliation between nongaap financial information to the gaap financial information is provided in the press release and supplemental slide presentation. this conference call will be available for replay via webcast through dun bradstreets investor relations website at investor.dnb.com. with that ill now turn the call over to anthony. anthony jabbour thank you sean. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. overall we delivered another solid result in both top and bottom lines. organic revenue growth was 4.3 up 40 basis points from the first quarter of 2023 and represents our fourth consecutive quarter of reported midsingledigit growth. with 90 of our revenues growing slightly over 6 in the quarter and on a trailing 12month basis we saw continued strong demand for our thirdparty supply chain risk and master data management solutions in both our north america and international segments. weve seen continued strength in these 2 areas of strategic investment and believe there is much more opportunity to grow in the coming years. the remaining 10 of our revenues comprised of credibility and digital marketing solutions continue to be negatively impacted by a variety of factors including broader macro conditions. however we have work underway to reduce their impact on the overall growth rate and ill spend some time in my prepared remarks discussing our remediation efforts and the timing thereof. from a profitability perspective ebitda grew 6 in the quarter driving 60 basis points of margin expansion. we continue to operate more efficiently and along with lower revenue growth from areas that have below average incremental margins we were able to deliver strong profitability in the quarter. we continue to focus our capital allocation on sustainable organic growth acceleration deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining our dividend while being opportunistic in both ma and share buybacks when circumstances allow. and while we continue to execute well our share price provided an attractive valuation throughout the quarter and we began to utilize our share repurchase authorization. throughout the quarter we were able to purchase around 960000 shares at an average price per share of around 9.70. we accomplished this while maintaining our net leverage ratio at 3.7x with visibility to around 3.5x by yearend. as we expect capitalized spend and other extraordinary investments to come down in the second half we continue to expect improved free cash flow conversion for the full year and well look to deploy it efficiently and effectively. and now turning to whats driving our financial results ill start with an update on our finance and risk solutions. across both segments we saw a strong performance in our core finance and risk solutions. finance solutions continues to be a deeply embedded solution set that creates an excellent platform for crossselling our risk solutions. while our finance and risk solutions are a key part of our 96 overall gross retention rate they are also a key part of our 36 vitality index with thirdparty risk management delivering another stellar quarter of over 20 growth. we are seeing strong demand for our risk analytics platform and even stronger demand for our risk data block solutions delivered via direct api integrations. while medium to largersized clients prefer a platform approach we are seeing the largest and megasized clients prefer direct integrations into their core applications. and while we continue to see growth and expansion with our medium and largersized customers throughout the world smaller clients are still a great opportunity for us in both north america and internationally. for instance in asia we saw high singledigit growth driven by some of our more localized finance solutions. as smaller companies throughout the region look to validate themselves as worthy suppliers to large multinational businesses db stands as a trusted provider of authentication and confidence. and while we have continued to transform our smb businesses in north america credibility continued to see some softness in the second quarter largely as expected. the second quarter was down 2.3 million or a 7 decline versus prior year and 4.1 million or a 6.4 decline yeartodate. the declines up to this point have been solutions that are directly impacted by the consent order and its impact on those renewals throughout last year and into early this year. we still expect the business to be near flat in q3 and then begin to slightly grow in q4 and remain positive as we are seeing green shoots in our new solution sales and in particular the improved performance of our credit insights product. while it took us a little longer to launch than expected im particularly excited about the early results we are seeing from the july 17 launch of our money back guarantee. and that coupled with the product enhancements we have made significantly increased the value we are providing to our clients and prospects. these efforts combined with several others are transforming the credibility solutions and give us confidence in our ability to turn this part of our negative 10 into a more positive contributor by the end of this year. now turning to our sales and marketing solutions. we grew midsingle digits overall driven by strong performance in master data management and improving performance and sales acceleration. the overall market remained constrained as delayed interest rate cuts persisted throughout the second quarter. but through the missioncritical nature of our mdm solutions and improving sales acceleration offerings we were able to offset much of the lackluster spending. that being said the majority of the business was growing nicely. our transactional volumes in digital marketing solutions remain depressed. while things didnt deteriorate further from the prior trends they certainly didnt improve at the rate we had expected. while the vast majority of our revenues are subscriptionbased our digital marketing solutions are more cyclical in nature and therefore impacted both positively and negatively by volume trends. for context these solutions were down 4.6 million or 14 in the second quarter and 7.7 million or 12 yeartodate. we anticipate improvement in the back half of this year for 3 reasons. the first is we expect the fed to begin to reduce interest rates driving increased spend. second google will no longer be deprecating cookies which should help with traditional volumes. and third we are expanding into rapidly growing areas such as connected tv retail media and further into social media. overall things have largely played out as we expected through the first 2 quarters of the year. and while we are tweaking our full year organic revenue guidance to take into account the lowerthanexpected transactional revenues from digital marketing we are maintaining our previous adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance. we will stay close to credibility and digital marketing that comprise the 10 of our revenues that are challenged throughout the remainder of this year and make any changes necessary to be set up to achieve a 2025 growth rate that is within the 5 to 7 range we previously discussed. another important element in our growth plan is continued innovation. in the second quarter we introduced hoover smart mail which allows automated messaging and deployment to hightargeted contacts for more individualized content creation. and in combination with smart search launched in q1 both now have over 4000 clients using these new gen ai capabilities. in addition we have our new chat db gen ai assistant. this is a patentpending autonomous ai agent that speaks to all of our data assets. there isnt a question about a business we cant answer. and this new assistant is being used by over 500 internal users and an early adopter testing with our clients. lastly our continued partnership with ibm has the new ask procurement assistant in early trials as well. as a reminder all of our gen ai solutions are based on ape our foundational architecture for quickly building testing and launching new solutions. along with the exciting progress in gen ai we continue to expand our duns and data graphs from the offline world to the online world. our businesstoperson or b2p service combining specific consumer marketing characteristics to our bestinclass b2b identity graph creating a uniquely blended offering. think about the b2p connection as focusing not on the individual as a consumer but the individual in his or her role within the defined organization. its still early stages but we believe this could be a game changer in the ability to effectively market to key business audiences in an everevolving landscape. and as we continue to develop and execute within our key product lines im also very pleased in our continued progress to finalize our cloud migration project. our technology team has made huge progress in the first half of this year upgrading and migrating our solutions to the cloud and we look forward to completing a majority of the heavy lifting by the end of this year. before i update you on some client successes in the quarter i wanted to provide a quick update on the general buying environment. similar to the comments youve heard from other industry peers the general sales environment has stayed relatively stable to the slower one that started late last year. our belief is that as the fed begins to take its first actions to reduce interest rates in the late fall businesses will become more constructive in their spending around new solutions and sales and marketing investments. and now turning back to q2 i want to start off with north america and a 5year renewal and expansion with a fortune 500 company and one of the worlds largest industrial supply companies. this client has been with us for over 25 years and continues to leverage the unparalleled breadth and depth of our data and analytics to create predictive risk scoring and automated credit decisioning. by leveraging our data and analytics to support over 2 million customers this company was able to create increased roi relative to automated upfront credit limits at onboarding and an analyticsdriven onboarding process that is helping to streamline the quotetocash process. another 5year renewal in the fr segment was with another fortune 500 company and one of the worlds premier providers of technology products and services for business government and education. the client has been with us for 25 years and continues to look for new and innovative ways to automate their credit and risk functions. through the addition of our new capabilities such as fa account manager we were able to provide them incremental tools to reduce the friction and ultimately time between sales credit and close. the team did a great job solutioning with our clients and delivering significant value through our latest db finance solutions. we also continue to see strong expansion within our master data management client base. one of the worlds largest technology companies has engaged us to assist in continuing to build out the uniform and structured process for sales and marketing programs across their enterprise. the leveraging of our specialized match capabilities contact management and support by our unique businesstoperson data on the programmatic and social marketing channels were able to support them with enhancing their marketleading position. they have one of if not the premier firstparty data sets in the world and by allowing us a trusted thirdparty provider add on to those exceptional capabilities has put them in an even more differentiated position. before turning to our international segment i wanted to finish up with a 3year deal in sales and marketing with another fortune 500 company and one of the largest human resources management software and services providers who has also been a client of ours for 25 years. through our differentiated data and enhanced match capabilities were able to support our clients lead optimization for customer crosssell through enhancing the foundation of their market research planning and customer segmentation efforts. by testing our data against other providers and focusing on streamlining to highquality process were able to grow our relationship with this client and create not only significant improvements to their marketing efforts but reduce costs overall for them by eliminating process inefficiencies driven by a multivendor strategy. on the international front we continue to see strong demand across our european and asian regions. in early q2 we signed a 3year deal for db data blocks for finance with hapaglloyd ag one of the leading global liner shipping companies to support their credit management automation. hapaglloyd is among the top 5 largest shipping and container transportation companies in the world and we are pleased to support their global need to manage financial risk in a more efficient and effective manner. hdi global se one of the largest insurance companies in europe signed a 3year contract for db data blocks to organize and manage its master data management support sales and marketing and optimize its risk management. this is a great example of how we can help create efficiencies across several use cases by clients leveraging our master data management capabilities. we also landed new business with a large global energy provider out of norway to manage their thirdparty risk management. this is a 3year contract and represents the largest sale to date of our new raci or risk analytics compliance intelligence solution. raci is an intelligent kyckyb monitoring and assessment solution for compliance risk management. it allows clients to streamline their onboarding processes quickly identify and verify entities and people their company looks to do business with defines risk relevancy and materiality based on the companys specific risk policies monitor changes to business partners so they can proactively mitigate risk and regularly screen business partners against sanctions watch lists pep lists and adverse media. we are very excited about how the raci pipeline is building and the early wins we are seeing with this newly introduced solution. and finally in asia we expanded our relationship with china mobile international with our finance analytics and compliance solutions that allow them global coverage of their overseas client credit risk and also drove new business with reliance industries in india a fortune 500 company and the largest private sector corporation in india to support their potential expansion into new locations. overall im proud of our teams focused execution against our longterm strategy and the results we are driving. over the trailing 12 months 90 of our revenues have grown 6 and with margins close to 40 putting us in a great position for continued future growth. with that id now like to turn the call over to bryan to discuss our financials in more detail and give a quick update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. bryan hipsher thank you anthony and good morning everyone. turning to slide 1. on a gaap basis second quarter revenues were 576 million an increase of 3.9 compared to the prior year quarter and an increase of 4.2 before the effect of foreign exchange. net loss for the second quarter was 16 million or a diluted loss per share of 0.04 compared to a net loss of 19 million for the prior year quarter. the 3 million decrease in net loss for the 3 months ended june 30 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to higher operating income partially offset by a lower tax benefit and the amortization loss related to the interest rate swap amendment completed in the third quarter of 2023. turning now to slide 2. ill now discuss our adjusted results for the second quarter. second quarter revenues for the total company were 576 million an increase of 3.9 compared to the prior year quarter and an increase of 4.2 before the effect of foreign exchange. the increase in revenues was attributable to growth in the underlying business partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the divestiture of a businesstoconsumer business in finland in the fourth quarter of 2023. and therefore our revenues on an organic constant currency basis were up 4.3. second quarter adjusted ebitda for the total company was 218 million an increase of 12 million or 6. this was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by higher costs driven by cloud infrastructure costs and net personnel expenses. second quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 38 an increase of 60 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. second quarter adjusted net income was 99 million or adjusted earnings per share of 0.23 compared to 95 million or 0.22 per share in the second quarter of 2023. the increase was primarily attributable to higher adjusted ebitda and lower interest expense in the current year quarter partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and tax expenses. turning now to slide 3. ill now discuss the results from our 2 segments north america and international. in north america revenues for the second quarter were 405 million an increase of 3 from prior year quarter and 3.4 on an organic constant currency basis. in finance and risk revenues were 216 million an increase of 5 million or 3 due to a net increase in revenue across our thirdparty risk supply chain management and finance solutions partially offset by decreased revenues from our credibility solutions. for sales and marketing revenue were 189 million an increase of 8 million or 4. sales and marketing growth was primarily driven by higher data sales and higher revenues from our master data management solutions partially offset by decreased revenues from our other digital marketing solutions. north america second quarter adjusted ebitda was 178 million an increase of 5 million or 3. and north america ebitda margin was 44 a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. this was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by higher costs driven by cloud infrastructure costs selling and marketing expenses as well as personnel costs supporting our overall solution innovation. turning to slide 4. in our international segment second quarter revenues increased 5 to 172 million or an increase of 6 before the effect of foreign exchange and an increase of 6.4 on an organic constant currency basis. finance and risk revenues were 160 million an increase of 8 or an increase of 9 before the effect of foreign exchange. all markets contributed to the growth including higher revenue from our api solutions in the united kingdom growth in europe from thirdparty risk and compliance finance analytics and api solutions and growth in greater china from finance analytics and api solutions along with increased revenues from worldwide network alliances due to increased crossborder activity. sales and marketing revenues were 55 million a decrease of 0.3 or an increase of 1 before the effect of foreign exchange. on an organic basis revenues grew 2 primarily due to higher revenues from the u.k. driven by growth in our api solutions. second quarter international adjusted ebitda of 54 million increased 5 million or 9.5. and adjusted ebitda margin was 31 an increase of 120 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. the increase in adjusted ebitda was due to revenue growth from the underlying business partially offset by higher net personnel costs and foreign exchange loss. turning to slide 5. slide 5 contains the details of our capital structure as of the quarterend. at the end of june 30 2024 we had cash and cash equivalents of 263 million and total principal amount of debt of 3676 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8. currently 87 of our debt is either fixed or hedged. and as of june 30 2024 we had 730 million available on our 850 million revolving credit facility. our leverage ratio was 3.7x on a net basis and the credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.2x. we expect to be at around 3.5x on a net basis by the end of this year as we continue to migrate towards our mediumterm range of 3 to 3.25x by 2025. turning now to our share repurchase program. as anthony mentioned during the second quarter we repurchased 961360 shares of dun bradstreet common stock for 9.3 million net of accrued excise tax at an average price of 9.71 per share. we currently have over 9 million shares remaining under our existing buyback authorization. now turning to slide 6. our outlook for 2024 is as follows total revenues after the effect of foreign currency are expected to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of 2400 million to 2440 million or an increase of approximately 3.7 to 5.4. this includes an assumption of a modestly increased headwind in the first 3 quarters of the year partially offset by a modest tailwind in the fourth quarter due to the effect of foreign currency related to the expected variances between the u.s. dollar euro british pound and swedish krona. revenues on an organic constant currency basis are expected to be at the low end of our previously communicated range of 4.1 to 5.1 for the full year. adjusted ebitda is expected to continue to be in the range of 930 million to 950 million and adjusted eps is expected to continue to be in the range of 1 to 1.04. additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows. we expect interest expense to be around 220 million depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of 125 million to 135 million excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting. adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 22 to 23 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 436 million. and for capex we expect approximately 150 million to 160 million of internally developed software and 45 million of property plant and equipment and purchased software as capitalized spend begins to moderate in the second half of this year. with the exception of some lower transactional revenues in north america the first 2 quarters played out largely as expected. and as we head into the second half of the year our expectations for the cadence of the remaining quarters remains unchanged with third quarter below the low end of the range and fourth quarter being slightly above the high end of the range. and finally with a heightened level of investment beginning to abate we continue to anticipate operating free cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income excluding the impact of the ar securitization to improve versus the prior year as previously discussed. with that were now happy to open the call for questions. operator will you please open up the line for qa operator [operator instructions] and the first question will be from andrew steinerman from jpmorgan. andrew steinerman anthony i wanted to hear more about the db credit insights launch. im looking through the product on the website. but if you could just help us understand why you feel like this will help revenue for the credibility section and how it differs really from the existing products within the credibility suite. anthony jabbour sure andrew. so a couple of points. the first is on the product itself. weve updated it in a significant way in terms of consolidating it making it easier for our clients to navigate. and as part of that weve also implemented different sales techniques around engagement with the clients. and what weve seen so far is a material improvement in our attrition in that base. so hanging on to clients and keeping them close. the second that we talk about with the money back guarantee is a really powerful one. and it took a little longer because like i said with compliance wanted to dot all the is cross all the ts around the money back guarantee. but essentially what thats saying to clients is if we cant help you improve it then you dont pay. so it creates a really simple value proposition compared to id say the consent order that we have to read with clients at the time. so i think for those reasons and like i said we launched that july 17 and in the later part of july we saw a nice improvement versus july last year on the sales side. so id say from a product improvement perspective the money back guarantee perspective our sales gotomarket changes that weve put in place and also that were adding some of our sales and marketing capabilities like hoovers and if these businesses are trying to improve their credit thats also trying to help them improve their business through sales and marketing capability. so its the combination of all of that andrew is why we feel good about this. andrew steinerman and is the product priced above or below lets say the legacy credibility products anthony jabbour sorry can you repeat that question andrew steinerman just pricing for the db credit insights is it priced higher than the legacy products within credibility or is it a more attractive price points to customers bryan hipsher no andrew its pretty consistent from a pricing perspective. and so as anthony said obviously with the guarantee were putting is a net benefit from that perspective. and then opening the aperture as we have in a lot of areas for alternative data assets the utilization of things outside of just manual trades. so were bringing in financial statements utility account payments other broader business credit card usage et cetera that gives a more holistic picture of a firm and allows them to continue to drive incremental benefit. but again from a cost perspective it will be on par with where we were before. anthony jabbour and the only thing ill add on to that is with the additional data that will be required for the money back guarantee access to a credit card statement bank accounts et cetera what were seeing in our [indiscernible] a 20 lift in credit when we have the additional data. and so from our perspective weve got confidence that we can help improve credit for small business which is great for the industry for the country. and also in the instances where we cant well also have more data adding on to the lead that we have in terms of data quality. operator the next question will be from heather balsky from bank of america. wahid amin its wahid amin on for heather. just want to touch on the digital marketing solutions. the issues sound more external macro related. can you discuss what you and the team are doing internally so you can offset these macro challenges if things potentially get worse anthony jabbour sure wahid. so a couple of things. we certainly think and you see it broadly in the sales and marketing industry in terms of the reduction in spend in the space and as theres more certainty on interest rate cuts coming we believe that will free up the spend and that will help not just us but the industry more generally. but also theres a number of things that are going on. so recently google announced that theyre not going to deprecate the cookie any longer. and that will drive more traditional volume for us and other players which will be positive. the other new channels that were starting in what was going to be just a cookieless world around connected tv retail media and social were penetrating those very got very nice growth rates in those albeit theyre small businesses and not contributing but the growth rate is very significant in those. so we feel good about it from that perspective as well and also going more directly to our clients where weve got broader relationships with and bringing this additional capability versus more traditionally leveraging agencies and the broader industry approach in the space. weve got a great client relationship. theres lots of ways that we can bring additional data and capability to those clients. and probably the last is we had very strong comps in this space last year at the beginning of the year and so the comps become more favorable at the back half of this year. wahid amin got it. and then on sales and marketing there was quite a bit of a step down sequentially internationally. can you talk about whats going on there differently compared to north america anthony jabbour yes sure. i think there like i said our revenues arent consistently following quartertoquarter all the time. weve seen that in the business a number of parts of our business domestically and internationally. i think the better approach in terms of the normalized for the timing of certain deliveries for example our client usage is looking at a broader range versus just a quarter and so we feel pretty confident about how that business is growing. bryan hipsher and wahid that one is obviously a smaller business. and as we went through some of the major migrations on the finance and risk side throughout last year there are some smaller ones that were working through this year. and so again quartertoquarter as anthony said you could have a little bit of movement. but if you look at the consistency throughout the year i think youll see that ultimately play out. operator and our next question will be from surinder thind from jefferies. surinder thind first question id like to just follow up on is i believe on the prepared remarks i heard about a willingness to make any changes to some of the revenues that are challenged. can you expand upon that comment it sounds like perhaps strategic options or maybe i misheard. anthony jabbour yes surinder id say everything is on the table for us. weve been working hard in terms of transforming this business. were really proud of it. when we look at 90 of our revenues growing 6 thats in the sweet spot and the margins near 40 the sweet spot of the best players right now in the industry. and so with the remaining well do whatever we need to do in terms of addressing those. and as you could see from my answers on smb and digital marketing we have a number of initiatives underway in terms of turning those around. but were open to id say everything is on the table from strategic partnerships different sort of licensing agreements et cetera to other strategic options. surinder thind understood. and then how integrated are those into the business or the ability to separate those how should we think about that or maybe some data dependencies between the various business lines anthony jabbour sure. id say on the digital marketing side its not as integrated. and on the smb side like i said the data that we collect is valuable in terms of its what enriches the strong data quality that we have that were known for and our clients benefit. and so theres ways to solve for id say for both of those on a goforward basis. but clearly our data if we were to pursue strategic options there would need to be the ongoing licensing agreements et cetera. surinder thind thats helpful. and then in terms of just investment back in the business obviously some color around the tech transformation and where we are and moving some of the products to the cloud. so as we think about other products and technologies that youre exploring lets say within ai how should we think about the rapid changes that are going on there and your ability to kind of invest at the pace that you want i mean would accelerated investments help or how do you think about balancing that anthony jabbour yes thats a great question and its one that were obviously very focused on. the beauty is were seeing some of our projects roll off which are helping us with our efficiency right so number one that in and of itself is great but also just we continue to build confidence internally in terms of hills that we want to take we take. and im really proud of the team and all their efforts that way. weve made investments. i shared the ai initiatives that weve got underway. the chat gpt one for example that also has a lot of internal use for it in terms of efficiency that we can say with our own customer service and on internal processes that we have today to create more efficiency. so id say from an investment perspective weve been very consistent and making the right longterm decisions for our company versus short term. and well continue to do that in terms of making sure we are in a position to always be successful in putting our clients in a similar position. so we feel really confident with the amount of investment that we have today based on where we see the market and the needs. and im excited with the capabilities that were coming up with. theyre candidly faster and better than i thought they would be by this stage if you had asked me a year ago. operator the next question will be from ashish sabadra from rbc capital markets. ashish sabadra its good to see the thirdparty risk management continue to grow at such a robust 20plus pace. i was wondering you obviously mentioned a couple of good wins there and some of the new technology innovations that youre putting in place which are gaining traction. i was thinking as you think about are you seeing any kind of slowdown from a macro challenge perspective but also anything from a regulatory perspective which is driving it how are you thinking about crossselling into the existing customer base versus winning new clients there as well so any incremental color there will be helpful. anthony jabbour yes ashish great questions. id say from a slowdown perspective your first one were seeing what the industry is seeing. youve seen on other calls that youve been on. its been pretty consistent since q4 of last year what the industry and the spend has been. id say weve we publish a global optimism report where we survey clients and see what how theyre feeling. and the majority of the indices that we track its positive right so the future looks brighter. but id say currently where the industry is at has been pretty consistent since q4 of last year. id say from our perspective i dont really see anything coming from a regulatory perspective that could hurt. typically when regulatory creeps in it creates more burden for clients. therefore more opportunity for us to help solve the pain for our clients. so as we talk about regulatory new regulatory requirements create pain for our clients and if we could sell pain killers those are easy to sell right because obviously our clients want the pain to go away as quickly as possible. id say on the crosssell side look were constantly looking at ways to crosssell. were crossselling very nicely into our finance solutions base which is great. but also were looking at crossselling everything that we have to all of our existing clients. the one example i gave in my prepared remarks about a client who was leveraging us for their onboarding what they had discovered was when they provided a credit limit to a client at the time of onboarding there was an increased roi on those clients. and so as we find examples like that simple one for example were going to take that to all of our existing clients and crosssell that use case and find ways to help them grow and crosssell more capability. so id say as i look to the future i believe the budgets will grow businesses feel more optimistic. and like said i feel that the success that were having will continue or accelerate. so thats why i said we feel very good about the upcoming years and building on the 90 that we have in this business growing at 6. ashish sabadra thats very helpful color. and again it is very encouraging to see the steps that have been taken to turn around credibility and the marketing solution digital marketing. i was just wondering other than that are there any other legacy products which may be a drag on growth and any strategic plan to either divest or turn them around anthony jabbour id say from a focus perspective our focus is on the 10 right now right we get that solved were looking very strong. and so thats what our focus is. so i dont see others popping up. what we have done weve migrated thousands and thousands of clients from legacy solutions to our most modern solutions. and thats helped us in so many ways from crosssell capabilities from a retention perspective multiyear contracts expense reductions on our side. so weve done a lot of that work. but like i said our real focus is the 10. operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our questionandanswer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to anthony jabbour for any closing remarks. anthony jabbour thank you. as always id like to thank my dun bradstreet colleagues for their exceptional efforts to sustainably grow our business for the years to come and to our great clients for their partnership and guidance. thank you for your interest in dun bradstreet for joining us on this call. i hope you enjoy the rest of your summer. operator the conference has now concluded. thank you for attending todays presentation. you may now disconnect..']"

open market repurchases of 139 million apple shares. as we move ahead into the september quarter id like to review our outlook which includes the types of forwardlooking information that suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. the color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesnt worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. we expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a yearoveryear basis. we expect our september quarter total company revenue to grow yearoveryear at a rate similar to the june quarter. we expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. we expect gross margin to be between 45.5 and 46.5. we expect opex to be between 14.2 billion and 14.4 billion. we expect oie to be around negative 50 million excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5. finally today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 0.25 per share of common stock payable on august 15 2024 to shareholders of record as of august 12 2024. with that lets open the call to questions. suhasini chandramouli thank you luca. we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. operator may we have the first question please operator certainly. we will go ahead and take our first question from erik woodring with morgan stanley. please go ahead. erik woodring great. thank you very much for taking my question. maybe tim if we start with you you know i thought some of the color you provided before the call about iphone 15 performing better than the iphone 14 was interesting. so just with that context can you maybe help us understand where you see iphone replacement cycles today where you think the size of the base of iphones that are aged and likely to upgrade are and what that translates to in potential pentup demand as we enter a new iphone cycle. and i have a followup thank you. tim cook yes hi eric. the installed base hit an alltime high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iphone in general grew in constant currency. and the 15 as you point out if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14 the 15 is doing better than the 14. and so thats kind of a state of where we currently are. in terms of upgrade rates its very difficult midcycle to call upgrade rates. i would just say that with apple intelligence we are very excited about the level of value that were going to provide to users. and we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade. erik woodring okay thats very helpful. thanks tim. and then second can you maybe dig into the china dynamics a bit sales down 6 this quarter 3 in constant currency an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iphone discounting. so can you maybe just share color on the china market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter how sustainable this improvement is and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the china market as we look forward. thanks so much. tim cook yeah erik as you point out we decreased by 6.5 yearoveryear for the whole of greater china. and if you look at it on a constant currency basis we declined by less than 3. so over 50 of the decline yearoveryear is currency related. that is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year and so were happy to see the acceleration. if you look at iphone in particular for greater china the installed base set a record. we also in mainland china set a june quarter record for upgraders and so thats a very strong signal and in fact from kantar the survey from kantar this quarter showed that iphones were the top three models in urban china. also if you look at one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. so this goes all the way back to the september of 2023. if you look at that the 15 is outperforming the 14. and so those are some of the color i would provide. in addition one of the things that were very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. and so if you look at this on the mac and ipad in mainland china the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time buying that product for the first time and the watch the vast vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. and during the quarter i should say also that ipad returned to growth in greater china as it did around the world. and so we continue to be confident in the longterm opportunity in china. i dont know how every chapter of the book reads but were very confident in the longterm. erik woodring great. thanks so much. tim cook yeah. suhasini chandramouli thank you erik. operator may we have the next question please operator our next question is from ben reitzes with melius. please go ahead. ben reitzes hey thanks a lot. appreciate it. hey tim you know now that youve launched or announced apple intelligence do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. would it do you feel like itll accelerate your services business augmented and maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. how are you thinking about it as a catalyst for services into next year and i have a followup. thanks. tim cook we started the rollout of apple intelligence this week with developers so some of the features are out there as of monday. and we couldnt be more excited about getting them out there. obviously this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. and so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there and we cant wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it. ben reitzes okay. thanks. and then luca with regard to gross margin its been theres been some component price inflation and mix. do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins thanks. luca maestri sure ben. i think ill give you a bit of the walk for the june quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the september quarter. at the total company level weve reported 46.3. it is down 30 basis points sequentially and it was really driven by a different mix. within products of course we launched very important products like the ipad during the course of the quarter. but we had an offset from a shift in mix towards services and we got some good cost savings. and so when you look at it on a yearoveryear basis we are up significantly on the margin front. and keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. as we go into the september quarter we are guiding 45.5 to 46.5 which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. again similar dynamics we expect a slightly different mix. we expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially although a more significant impact on a yearoveryear basis. on the commodity side i think that is what you are referring to yes we have seen some increases on the memory front but the rest of the commodities we see a continuous decline. so in general we feel were well positioned. and as you know well these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are. ben reitzes okay. thanks a lot. suhasini chandramouli thank you ben. operator may we have the next question please. operator our next question is from mike ng with goldman sachs. please go ahead. mike ng hi good afternoon. i just have two questions. first i was wondering if you could talk about whether or not youve seen a shift in demand for iphone 15 pro pro max models since wwdc that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for apple intelligence enabled phones tim cook we just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in june. and so we had very limited time during the quarter. so its really too early to tell. mike ng thats fair. and then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years i was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the us promotional environment from your channel partners whether thats us wireless carriers given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period thank you. tim cook we are very excited about apple intelligence and what it brings and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. id leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. but i believe it will be a very key time for and a compelling upgrade cycle. mike ng great. thank you tim. suhasini chandramouli thanks mike. operator can we have the next question please. operator our next question is from amit daryanani with evercore. please go ahead. amit daryanani good afternoon everyone. and i have two as well. i guess tim maybe back to the apple intelligence dynamic. theres clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what apple intelligence could mean for them. can you just touch on your do you think the intent is to launch all the apple intelligence features at the same time to consumers or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit and if they are staggered do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the nextgeneration iphone tim cook the rollout as we mentioned in june sort of weve actually started with developers this week. we started with some features of apple intelligence not the complete suite. there are other features like languages beyond us english that will happen over the course of the year and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. and chatgpt is integrated by the end of the calendar year. and so yes so its a staggered launch. amit daryanani got it. and then i guess your services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. can you just touch talk about when you look at this doubledigit growth how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better arpu or better monetization of the installed base and how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward luca maestri yes amit it is luca. its a combination of a number of factors. the installed base growth is very important of course because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our services. we are seeing and weve seen this consistently for many many quarters now. we see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. we have more transacting accounts every quarter so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. we see paid accounts growing double digits and weve seen that for many many quarters. now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform and they are growing strong double digits as well. so obviously the growing level of engagement helps us both from an arpu standpoint and just a volume standpoint. obviously as youve seen over the last several years we launched new services over time and weve launched many new services fairly recently. obviously our payments business is relatively new apple tv apple arcade fitness so many other services weve added. and so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. and we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. we continue to make significant investments on tv on apple arcade. we are launching new shows new games all the time. and i think you will continue to see that as we go forward. we are very very happy with the 14 growth that we had this quarter because particularly if you look at the performance that we had in services a year ago the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. but in spite of that we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. suhasini chandramouli thanks amit. operator we will take the next question please. operator our next question is from wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead. wamsi mohan yes. thank you so much. tim you announced apple intelligence but you also announced partnerships with openai and presumably more coming down the road. how should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the capex investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. but youre obviously theyre leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. so in the longterm do you see the apple intelligence part the services growth from apple intelligence being the larger contributor over time or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time and i have a followup. tim cook i think the way that i look at it is that apple intelligence is the ondevice processing and the private cloud compute. and a lot of that will be things with a personal context. and then for world knowledge we are integrating with chatgpt initially and that will be focused on world knowledge as i said. and so the monetization model i dont want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. but i see both aspects as being very important. people want both. wamsi mohan okay. thanks. as a followup maybe for luca. just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. if i look at calendar 2023 you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a yearonyear basis. in 2024 so far it had been more flat yearonyear. when we think about that is the incremental headwind i mean there was fx headwinds throughout the last several years. so exfx are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins thank you. luca maestri yes. of course as you said the foreign exchange continues to be this is incremental on a yearoveryear basis. and it is one of those things that is outside of our control. we try to hedge our exposures. but it is what it is. we know that when the dollar is strong our gross margins are affected. the other element that i think its always important to keep in mind is that within the products business our products have different margin profiles. and depending on the relative success in the marketplace our products gross margin tends to move. and so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins right and so we need to pay attention to that. of course we just launched an ipad and that is one of the factors. but we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. and thats why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. the other factor that obviously has an impact a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets and they tend to go in cycles. and so we will see how that plays out over time. but in general we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business and we think we are in a good position there. suhasini chandramouli thanks wamsi. operator can we have the next question please. operator our next question is from krish sankar with td cowen. please go ahead. krish sankar hi thanks for taking my question. and congrats on the strong results. the first one for luca or tim. we keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for ai edge devices. and also i think luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. so im curious how to think about margins for these new ai devices. and tim do any of these apple intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today and then i have a quick followup. tim cook maybe ill take the second one first and then pass it over to luca. in terms of the requirements to run apple intelligence there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. and so from an iphone point of view the iphone 15 pro and pro max will run apple intelligence and the successor products obviously. if you look at the mac it starts with the m series of silicon that started in 2020. and the ipad is the same and so it starts with the m series of silicon. and so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those. luca maestri and from a gross margin standpoint as you know we dont provide any color past the current quarter and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5 to 46.5. it is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the june quarter. so well take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by. krish sankar got it. very helpful. and then a quick followup for tim. thanks for the color on china. we also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak china. and i think tim you said half the details was fx related. im curious the other half of the weakness was that more china macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to apple with domestic competitors any other color you could give would be very helpful. thank you very much. tim cook well certainly the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. ive said that before and that remains to be the case. the macroeconomic factors have been in the press too and im not an expert on those. i can only tell you what were seeing. and we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year. krish sankar thanks tim. suhasini chandramouli thank you krish. operator can we have the next question please. operator our next question is from david vogt with ubs. please go ahead. david vogt great. two if i may also. tim first one for you. i know it is early days and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on apple intelligence. but when you think about the categories that are currently in the app store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology whats your instinct say in terms of are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to apple intelligence is it games is it more creative im just trying to get a sense of how youre thinking about it. and then i have a followup for luca. thanks. tim cook if you look at how weve deployed apple intelligence or are deploying apple intelligence weve really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. and so weve thought about it from notes to mail to messages and all the rest. and so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. and thats going to surface apple intelligence in a way that is natural to the user in a way that will i think get them very excited about it and get usage. similarly i think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. and so i think it is profound and well see what the developers do. but were very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. i think it will be amazing yes. david vogt yes. no thats helpful. i appreciate it. and luca just maybe i know you didnt give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. but if i kind of take your comments at face value i guess what im trying to think about is for the next quarter it sounds like with services being relatively strong and fx easing a little bit. you are effectively saying that product revenue in the september quarter is going to basically be flat with the september quarter last year ahead of a product launch. and so im just trying to get a sense for what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have apple intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward thanks. luca maestri well we have provided let me repeat what we provided. we think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported so the plus 5 right in spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds and we said about 150 basis points in the december quarter. and we said that we will grow services double digits at a rate that is similar to what weve reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. we are not going into the other categories. i think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what weve given you here. keep in mind on the mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the macbook air 15inch a year ago. and also on the ipad we reported 24 growth in the june quarter. clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the june quarter of the new products the ipad air and the ipad pro. so important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis. david vogt great. thank you very much. suhasini chandramouli thank you david. operator may we have the next question please. operator our next question is from atif malik with citi. please go ahead. atif malik hi thank you for taking my question. the first one is for tim. i know its early days. the feedback on apple intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the ios 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. my question is in response to an earlier question you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. so are you expecting most of the features that you announced at wwdc to be part of ios 18 or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of ios 19 next year tim cook our objective that we said in june is to roll out us english starting in the fall and that is to users and then proceed with more functionality more features if you will and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. and so we sort of gave a time frame that and were tracking to that. atif malik understand. and the next one for luca. luca the services growth momentum seems very strong. are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the dma rules luca maestri well as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the app store in europe already in march. and we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. we are on an ongoing basis discussing with the european commission how to ensure full compliance with the dma. it is obviously early stage but in general our results for the services business and for the app store have been pretty good until now. again to just provide you a frame of reference the percentage of revenue that we generate from the european union on the app store is about 7 of the total. atif malik very helpful. thank you. suhasini chandramouli thank you atif. operator may we have the next question please. operator our next question is from samik chatterjee with jpmorgan. please go ahead. samik chatterjee yes. hi. thanks for taking my question. i guess tim if i can just ask you about apple intelligence as well. there is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. you mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines youre thinking. how are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process in particular like eu and maybe china and does in terms of your timelines of the rollout are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here and how should we think about timing then including that and i have a followup. thank you. tim cook we are engaged as you would guess with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. and our objective is to move as fast as we can obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. we have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. but were very constructively engaged with both. samik chatterjee okay got it. and a quick one on the wearables category luca. i know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what which categories drove the acceleration because thats been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. so just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis thank you. tim cook yes ill take that one. i think the important thing to remember when you look at the wearables home and accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. and weve been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the airpods pro second generation the watch se and the very first watch ultra. and so it is important to keep that in mind. if you sort of take a step back however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months it is grown the wearables home and accessories business has grown to almost 40 billion which is double what it was five years ago. samik chatterjee thank you. suhasini chandramouli thank you samik. operator may we have the last question please. operator our last question is from richard kramer with arete research. please go ahead. richard kramer thanks. thanks very much. tim you referenced the investment in innovation and your rd sales ratio reached what i think was a june quarter record even before launching apple intelligence. do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in rd or increases in opex or capex for cloud compute capacity and is it even possible to forecast the services usage as they roll out given that they are so new for consumers thanks. tim cook clearly we have increased rd over time. we have been investing in ai and ml for years. and in addition to investing more weve also redeployed certain skills onto ai and ml. and so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that weve shared here it is increasing yearoveryear. on the capex part it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the capex would appear in their respective businesses. but yes i mean you can expect that there is we will continue to invest and increase it yearonyear. richard kramer okay. and maybe a quick followup for luca. when we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months they are up materially. and given this years product mix can you describe to us what exactly in the services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business luca maestri yes im glad you noticed that. we are pretty pleased with that fact. and i think you probably also noticed that weve increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. this one was a record quarter for us. well its a combination of a number of things. of course an improvement in the topline helps the margin expansion that weve had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. and so that is driving better operating cash flow. on the capex front as tim said we employ a hybrid model. some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay as we go. but in general we try to run the company efficiently. we continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. and therefore we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year. richard kramer okay. thanks. suhasini chandramouli thank you richard. a replay of todays call
